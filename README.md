# Windows Forms "Car & Track DB"
Store your cars and tracks in DB.

## Interface
- you can upload and save your database in an XML file
- after you upload the car and track data (left table), the program will generate 10-20 random cars/tracks with
the registration number in the right table
- the rows for the right table are generated by a random color, and this color keeps his state
- you can edit the data in the left table and it automatically syncs with other open applications
- you won't lose your data
